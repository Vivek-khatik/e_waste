In this project, I designed and developed a dynamic and feature-rich mobile
application using Flutter, a popular cross-platform development framework. The
primary goal of the application was to provide users with a seamless and interactive
experience while accessing and managing various data. To achieve this, I integrated
a PHP-based API to facilitate communication between the Flutter application and
the MySQL database.
